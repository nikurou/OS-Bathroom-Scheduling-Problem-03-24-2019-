# OS-Bathroom-Scheduling-Problem-03-24-2019-
An all-gender public bathroom exists in such that only a maxim of 3 people may occupy the bathroom at the same time, however all occupants must be of the same gender. Given a queue of female/male people waiting to use the bathroom, this program will allow them to use the bathroom in a efficient schedule that does not break the rules.
